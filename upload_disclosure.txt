Cloud Upload Disclosure

The initial mesh processing is cloud based and therefore requires 
the transmission of the surface mesh to a Google Cloud server for 
processing.  The goal of this project is to create a large data 
set of segmented meshes for later analysis.  For that reason, the 
result of the segmentation is also uploaded to a Google Cloud server.  
Because machine learning is new area of exploration, we may contract 
with 3rd parties to analyze it in bulk.  It is important that no patient 
identifiers be in the file names, or embossed in the geometry of the 
model.  Because only the mesh geometry is stored with randomized file 
names, we have no way to allow access to any particular file that a 
user uploads.  

In summary

1.  Mesh surface data will be transmitted to, processed and stored 
on a server
2.  No data is stored which maps it to the original user
3.  The data will not be accessible by the user aftward
4.  We will use the data for further research, potentially 
including transfer to 3rd parties for analysis.
5.  No patient data should be included in the object name or 3D 
geometry of the mesh file.
